# Features

In this section, we'll explore the different features that Buggregator supports and how they can help you identify and
resolve issues with your application.

## 1. Xhprof profiler

The Xhprof profiler is an essential feature of Buggregator that offers a lightweight and hierarchical profiling solution
for PHP applications. It uses instrumentation to keep track of call counts and inclusive metrics for arcs in the dynamic
callgraph of your program during the data collection phase. In the reporting and post-processing phase, the profiler
computes exclusive metrics such as wall (elapsed) time, CPU time, and memory usage.

With the Xhprof profiler, you can easily identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your application's code for
better efficiency. So, if you're looking to fine-tune your PHP application's performance, the Xhprof profiler is the
perfect tool for the job.

![xhprof](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/773481/208724383-3790a3e1-9ebe-4616-8d4d-d1869f8f2b7c.png)

### Installation

1. Install Xhprof extension
   One of the way to install Xhprof is to use [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/package/xhprof) package.

```bash
pear channel-update pear.php.net
pecl install xhprof
```

2. Install the package

If you are using Spiral Framework you just need to install
the [spiral/profiler](https://github.com/spiral/profiler/tree/3.0) package.

```bash
composer require --dev spiral/profiler:^3.0
```

### Configuration

After installing the package, you need to configure it. The package provides predefined environment variables to
configure the profiler.

```dotenv
PROFILER_ENDPOINT=http://profiler@127.0.0.1:8000
PROFILER_APP_NAME=My super app
```

> **Note:**
> Read more about package usage in the [package documentation](https://github.com/spiral/profiler/tree/3.0).

## 2. Symfony VarDumper server

Buggregator is fully compatible with the
Symfony [VarDumper component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/var_dumper.html#the-dump-server), which is an
essential feature for debugging PHP applications. By default, the `dump()` and `dd()` functions output their contents
in the same browser window or console terminal as your own application. This can be confusing at times, as it mixes the
real output with the debug output.

With Buggregator, however, you can easily collect all the dumped data, making it simpler to identify and isolate issues.
So, whether you're an experienced developer or just starting, the Symfony VarDumper server in Buggregator is an
essential tool to have in your development arsenal.

![var-dumper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/773481/208727353-b8201775-c360-410b-b5c8-d83843d388ff.png)

### Installation

```bash
composer require --dev symfony/var-dumper
```

### Configuration

You should change dumper format to `server` for var-dumper component. There is a `VAR_DUMPER_FORMAT` env variable in the
package to do it.

```dotenv
VAR_DUMPER_FORMAT=server
VAR_DUMPER_SERVER=127.0.0.1:9912 # Default value
```

via PHP

```php
// Plain PHP
$_SERVER['VAR_DUMPER_FORMAT'] = 'server';
$_SERVER['VAR_DUMPER_SERVER'] = '127.0.0.1:9912';
```

----

## 3. Fake SMTP server for catching mail

Buggregator is more than just a PHP debugging tool. It also includes a powerful email testing feature that allows you to
install and configure a local email server with ease.

For example, you can configure a local WordPress site to use Buggregator's SMTP server for email deliveries. This makes
it effortless to test email functionality during the development phase, ensuring that everything works as expected
before deployment. So, if you're looking for a reliable and easy-to-use email testing tool, Buggregator's fake SMTP
server is the way to go.

![smtp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/773481/208727862-229fda5f-3504-4377-921e-03f0ff602cb9.png)

## 7. HTTP Requests dump server

It's an indispensable tool that simplifies the process of capturing, analyzing, and debugging HTTP requests in their
applications. With the HTTP Requests Dump Server, developers can effortlessly capture all the relevant request data and
gain valuable insights. They can dive deep into the captured requests, examine their contents, and pinpoint any issues
or anomalies that might be affecting their application's performance.

Simply start the server and send your requests to the `http://http-dump@127.0.0.1:8000` URL, it will not only
capture the URI segments but also gather additional details such as the request `headers`, `cookies`, `POST data`,
`query strings`, and any `uploaded files`.

For instance, let's say you have a POST request: `http://http-dump@127.0.0.1:8000/user/3/update`. In this case,
server will intercept the request and capture all the relevant information. It will then display the
dumped data, allowing you to examine the request details, including the URI segments (`user/3/update` in this example).
